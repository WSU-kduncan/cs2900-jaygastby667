Part 1 - Building VMs
  I downloaded a Kali Linux virtual box image to set up my guest OS. 
  Once downloaded all I had to do was use the add feature of virtual box and locate the image. 
  I stuck with the recommended setting which included 2048MB of memory / RAM allocation. 
  I did not allow for 3D acceleration and for the moment I left it to Nat for the networking. 
  
  Part 2 - Exploring Virtualization
From your host, can you access the files and folders you create in the guest directory through this folder? Why or why not?
  I cannot, I believe that I would need to mount a shared folder that would allow for me to access shared files through that.

The hypervisor manages virtualized networking devices for your Guest to connect to the outside world
  With the Nat connect through my host machine I am able to access the internet with its own IP.
